# H.265Insight
HEVC v2 / ITU-T H.265 v2 (10/2014) decoding process analyzer.

**i265** implements decoding process as defined by **ITU-T H.265** (http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.265-201504-I/en).

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/vlad83/H.265Insight.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vlad83/H.265Insight)

### Deviation from ITU-T H.265 v2 (10/2014) and v3 (04/2015) specifications

* It is specified that **escapeDataPresent** flag should be reset every block but technical intent was to reset it every subblock (https://hevc.hhi.fraunhofer.de/trac/hevc/ticket/1391). This is considered as BUG in text and implementation resets it every subblock.

## Requirements

- C++11 conformant compiler. Project is being built with GCC 4.9.3/5.4.0/6.1.1 and CLANG 3.8.0 (https://travis-ci.org/vlad83/H.265Insight)
- CMake
- POSIX API and GNU extensions, required by TerminationTools (backtrace pretty printer, can be easily disabled)

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/vlad83/H.265Insight
mkdir obj
cd obj
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ../H.265Insight
make
```

**i265** binary is located in obj/bin directory. For complete list of build time options see Flags.cmake

## Continuous Integration

Verification of complete set of **HEVC v1 conformance streams**
provided by **JCTVC** at http://wftp3.itu.int/av-arch/jctvc-site/bitstream_exchange/draft_conformance/HEVC_v1
is available in RELEASE builds at https://travis-ci.org/vlad83/H.265Insight

## Example

Directory **example** contains analysis files for:
 http://wftp3.itu.int/av-arch/jctvc-site/bitstream_exchange/draft_conformance/HEVC_v1/VPSID_A_VIDYO_2.zip
 ```
 ./bin/i265 -i VPSID_A_VIDYO_2.bit -n 3 -l all -o 2
 ```
Intermediate and final YUVs are located in **example/YUVs**.

YUV images produced by **i265** can be viewed by **YUVViewer** (http://www.mlynki.wz.cz/english_i/einfoc23.htm).
Two output modes are supported **discrete** and **continuous**.
